# Starting point for text analysis and creating a predictive model using naive Bayes

The script takes a while to run so I recommend running it in the terminal rather
than running in RStudio.

```
Rscript naiveBayes.R
```

## Requirements
* dplyr package

* tidytext package

* tm package

* e1071 package
```
install.packages(c("dplyr", "tidytext", "tm", "e1071"))
```

## Resources
* [Kaggle info and submit](https://www.kaggle.com/c/msk-redefining-cancer-treatment)
* [Text Mining with R](http://tidytextmining.com/tidytext.html)
* [Text mining and machine learning in R](http://data-analytics.net/cep/Schedule_files/Textmining%20%20Clustering,%20Topic%20Modeling,%20and%20Classification.htm)

## Next steps
* Ways of cleaning data
* Making data meaningful i.e. any terms that associate particularly with cancer?
